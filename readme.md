### repo to store my wallpapers

wallpaper are not organized in folder but i will try to organize them.

### Sources
I am going to try to start adding sources.  A lot of these would take me
forever to find the sources, so all sources are added post my realization.


- most of the wallpapers are from wallheaven
- Some are from ThePrimeagen's [wallpaper repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/anime) git repository
- Some are from DistroTube's [wallpaper repo](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers) specifically nature ones.
- Ghibli Studio wallpapers: [https://www.ghibli.jp/info/013409/](https://www.ghibli.jp/info/013409/)
